## A short tutorial I wrote to help explain factories in Object Oriented Programming.

* Clone the project to your computer and open it in VSCode.
* Read through factoryEx1.js and run it _(node factoryEx1.js)_
* Read through factoryEx2.js and run it _(node factoryEx2.js)_
* Alter whatever you see fit for your amusement and practice
